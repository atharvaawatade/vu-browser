## 🔌 Plugin Development

### Creating a Plugin

1. **Create plugin directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir plugins/my-plugin
   cd plugins/my-plugin
   ```

2. **Create manifest.json**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "my-plugin",
     "name": "My Plugin",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "My awesome plugin",
     "author": "Your Name",
     "main": "index.js",
     "permissions": ["tabs", "notifications"],
     "engines": {
       "simplivu": ">=1.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create plugin code**
   ```javascript
   class MyPlugin {
     async initialize(api) {
       this.api = api;
       console.log('My plugin initialized!');
       
       // Add menu item
       this.api.addMenuItem({
         id: 'my-action',
         label: 'My Action',
         action: () => this.doSomething()
       });
     }

     doSomething() {
       this.api.showNotification('Hello from my plugin!', 'success');
     }

     async cleanup() {
       console.log('My plugin cleaned up');
     }
   }

   module.exports = MyPlugin;
   ```

### Plugin API

The plugin API provides access to browser functionality:

```javascript
// Browser API
await api.createTab('https://example.com');
await api.closeTab(tabId);
const tab = await api.getCurrentTab();

// UI API
api.showNotification('Message', 'success');
const menuId = api.addMenuItem(menuItem);
api.removeMenuItem(menuId);

// Storage API
await api.setData('key', value);
const value = await api.getData('key');
await api.removeData('key');

// Events API
api.on('tab-created', callback);
api.off('tab-created', callback);
api.emit('custom-event', data);
```
